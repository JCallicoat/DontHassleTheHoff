# Dont Hassle The Hoff

A .net David Hasselhoff screensaver

This was created like 8 years ago to troll people at work who left their computer unlocked.

Recently rebuilt with current mono, so should work on linux. Probably needs mono installed on Mac as the packaged mono binary is built for linux.

Download the hoff.tar.xz, extract it, cd to release/, execute ./run.sh and the "screensaver" should start.

Type "hoff" or hit spacebar four times to exit the program. Typing anything else or clicking will warn you not to hassle the Hoff.
